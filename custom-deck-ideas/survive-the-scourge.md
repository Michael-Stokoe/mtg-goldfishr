# **Zombie-Themed Challenge Deck Rules**

1. **Objective:** The objective of the Zombie-themed challenge deck is to outlast the zombie horde by depleting their library. Players must work together to survive and prevent the zombies from overwhelming them.

2. **Setup:** 
   - The challenge deck consists of 60 cards as listed in the decklist.
   - The challenge deck operates with infinite mana, and it doesn't have a hand or life total.
   - Each player starts with 20 life.

3. **Win Condition:** The challenge deck does not have a traditional win condition. Instead, the players win by outlasting the zombies. The challenge deck loses when it has no cards left in its library.

4. **Turn Sequence:** Players take their turns simultaneously. There is no specific order for players to take their turns; instead, players may discuss and coordinate their actions freely.

5. **Zombie Horde:** The challenge deck controls a growing army of zombies represented by the Zombie creature tokens. These zombies are relentless and attack each turn if able. They also have various abilities to disrupt the players.

6. **Undead Horde:** The Undead Horde card in the challenge deck is a powerful zombie creature. Players cannot defeat it through combat. Instead, it's crucial to focus on outlasting the zombie horde by depleting their library.

7. **Endless Horde:** The Endless Horde enchantment allows the challenge deck to continually cast cards from its library. Players must be prepared to face a constant onslaught of zombies.

8. **Hero's Reward:** When a card in the challenge deck leaves the battlefield, players may gain benefits known as Hero's Rewards. These rewards can include drawing cards, gaining life, or other advantages that help them endure the zombie assault.

9. **Discussion:** Players are encouraged to communicate and strategize during their turns. They should work together to decide which actions to take and which zombies to target.

10. **Reshuffling:** If the challenge deck's library is ever empty, reshuffle its graveyard and exile zone (if any) to form a new library. The relentless zombies keep coming back.

11. **Cooperation:** Players must cooperate and coordinate their efforts to survive. It's essential to strategize, prioritize threats, and manage resources effectively.

12. **Player Elimination:** While there is no traditional life total, if a player cannot draw cards from their library (decking themselves), they are considered eliminated from the game. Players who are eliminated can continue to participate in discussions and provide input but cannot take actions.

13. **Heroic Victory:** The players achieve a heroic victory when they successfully outlast the zombie horde by depleting the challenge deck's library. They can celebrate their survival and victory together.
