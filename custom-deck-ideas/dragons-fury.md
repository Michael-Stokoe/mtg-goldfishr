# Rules for the Dragon's Fury Challenge Deck:

**Objective**: The objective of the Dragon's Fury challenge deck is to defeat the enraged Dragon before it accumulates too many Fury Counters and becomes unstoppable.

**Setup**:

The challenge deck consists of 60 cards, including various Dragon creatures, spells, and enchantments that relate to the Dragon's fury.
The challenge deck operates with infinite mana and doesn't have a hand or life total.
Each player starts with 20 life.
The Enraged Dragon: The central focus of the challenge deck is the Enraged Dragon. The Dragon starts with a certain number of Fury Counters, representing its initial fury.

**Fury Counters**: The Enraged Dragon begins with, for example, 10 Fury Counters. At the beginning of the Dragon's turn, it gains a Fury Counter. Fury Counters can be used to fuel powerful abilities, and as the Dragon accumulates more Fury Counters, its abilities become even more devastating.

**Dragon Abilities**: The Dragon has a set of unique abilities that it can activate by spending Fury Counters. These abilities might include powerful attacks, spells, or other destructive actions. Players must work together to reduce the Dragon's Fury Counters and prevent it from using its abilities.

**Player Actions**: Players can take actions during their turns to disrupt the Dragon's Fury Counters. These actions might include casting spells, using Hero cards (if available), or taking other strategic measures to keep the Dragon's fury in check.

**Winning the Game**: Players win the game if they can reduce the Dragon's Fury Counters to zero and defeat the Enraged Dragon. However, if the Dragon accumulates a certain threshold of Fury Counters (e.g., 20), it becomes unstoppable, and players lose the game.

**Cooperation**: Players must coordinate their efforts and use their resources wisely to counter the Dragon's growing fury. Timing and strategy are essential to outsmart the Dragon and achieve victory.

This Dragon's Fury challenge deck introduces a unique mechanic centered around Fury Counters, where the Dragon becomes more dangerous as it accumulates rage.
