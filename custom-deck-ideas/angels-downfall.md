# Rules

**Angel-Themed Challenge Deck Rules**

1. **Objective:** The objective of the Angel-themed challenge deck is to defeat the Angelic Host, a powerful and angelic creature that the players must eliminate to win the game. Players work together to overcome the Angelic Host's defenses and emerge victorious.

2. **Setup:** 
   - The challenge deck consists of 60 cards as listed in the decklist.
   - The challenge deck operates with infinite mana and doesn't have a hand or life total.
   - Each player starts with 20 life.

3. **Win Condition:** The challenge deck does not have a traditional win condition. Instead, the players win by defeating the Angelic Host. The challenge deck wins if all players have been eliminated from the game.

4. **Turn Sequence:** Players take their turns simultaneously. There is no specific order for players to take their turns; instead, players may discuss and coordinate their actions freely.

5. **Angelic Host:** The Angelic Host is a formidable creature that players must defeat to win the game. It begins the game on the battlefield with several defenses, including hexproof and indestructible. The Angelic Host does not attack but has powerful abilities that can impact the game.

6. **Player Cooperation:** Players must cooperate and work together to defeat the Angelic Host. They need to combine their resources, spells, and strategies to overcome its defenses.

7. **Hero Cards:** Players have access to Hero cards that provide special abilities and advantages. These Hero cards can assist players in their battle against the Angelic Host. Players may have up to two Hero cards on the battlefield at any given time.

8. **Angelic Defenses:** The Angelic Host has hexproof, which means it cannot be targeted by spells or abilities controlled by players. It also has indestructible, making it immune to destruction effects.

9. **Angelic Power:** The Angelic Host has the ability to grow stronger over time. As the game progresses, it may acquire additional abilities and become even more challenging to defeat.

10. **Defeating the Angelic Host:** Players must find a way to bypass the Angelic Host's defenses, target it with spells or abilities, and reduce its toughness to zero to defeat it. Hero cards and special abilities can be crucial in achieving this.

11. **Player Elimination:** While there is no traditional life total, if a player cannot draw cards from their library (decking themselves), they are considered eliminated from the game. Players who are eliminated can continue to participate in discussions and provide input but cannot take actions.

12. **Heroic Victory:** The players achieve a heroic victory when they successfully defeat the Angelic Host. They can celebrate their triumph together as they have overcome a formidable foe.
